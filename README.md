# Responsive Web Design Guided Projects

Welcome to my collection of Responsive Web Design projects! These guided mini-projects are part of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) curriculum, designed to help you learn the skills necessary to create responsive and modern web designs. Completing these projects is a key step toward obtaining the Responsive Web Design Certification.

## Overview

As part of the FCC Responsive Web Design Certification, these projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with various web design principles and techniques. Each project focuses on different aspects of responsive design, helping me to build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design practices.

## Progress

Through these projects, I was able to obtain my FCC certification for Responsive Web Design! I have created more specific repositories for the major projects! These ones are just the minor ones that you complete to learn the necessary skills! I have numbered the projects based on their sequence of completion. Here is a link to the curriculum: [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

## Projects Included

These projects are designed to be completed in sequence, each building on the skills learned in the previous ones. By working through these projects, I gained practical experience with:

- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- Responsive design principles
